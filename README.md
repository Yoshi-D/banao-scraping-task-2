Scraping Twitter profiles using Selenium.

Since Twitter (now X) does not really allow viewing of profiles without logging in to an account, the code first logs in to an account. Then it opens up the profiles which it reads
from a csv file and extracts details like following, followers, bio, etc. Data is saved to a csv file.
